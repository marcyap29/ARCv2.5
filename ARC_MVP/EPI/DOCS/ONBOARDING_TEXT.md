# LUMARA Onboarding Text - Complete Collection

Onboarding is **personality-only** for the user: it lets them set how LUMARA talks and works with them. Phases are for **internal use by the model only** and are not introduced or revealed in onboarding.

## Screen 1: LUMARA Introduction

**Main Heading:**
> Hi, I'm LUMARA, your personal intelligence.

**Body Text:**
> I'm here to understand your narrative arc. As you journal and reflect, I learn the patterns in your journey—not just what happened, but what it means for where you're going.
> 
> I'll help you see the story you're living.

**Instruction:**
> Tap to continue

## Screen 2: LUMARA Capabilities

**Main Heading:**
> What LUMARA does for you.

**Body Text:**
> I remember your story so we don't start from zero each time. I notice patterns in your entries over time—what's shifting, what matters most. I match my tone and depth to where you actually are: calmer when you need rest, more direct when you're ready to move. That's how every conversation stays relevant.

**Primary Button:**
> Set how we'll work together

**Secondary:**
> Jump in →

*(Both go to Personality Setup.)*
