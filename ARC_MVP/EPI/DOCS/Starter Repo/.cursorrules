# Cursor Rules — [Project Name]

# Documentation
- Update DOCS/ when making architectural or behavioral changes.
- Run doc sync before significant git pushes (see claude.md).
- Keep CHANGELOG.md, CONFIGURATION_MANAGEMENT.md, and bugtracker/ in sync with code changes.

# Code style
- Follow existing conventions in the codebase.
- Prefer readability and maintainability over cleverness.

# Bug tracking
- Add a bug record in DOCS/bugtracker/records/ when fixing a non-trivial bug.
- Link fixes to CHANGELOG entries in the "Recent code changes" table.

# Architecture
- Respect module boundaries and data flow (see ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Do not introduce dependencies that conflict with documented architecture.
