# ARC MVP — Project Brief for Cursor

## Overview
ARC is the **core journaling module of EPI (Evolving Personal Intelligence)**, built using a new 8-module architecture. It is a journaling app that treats reflection as a **sacred act**. The experience should feel like the *Blessed* app: calming, atmospheric, and emotionally resonant. Journaling is the entry point, but the core differentiation is that each entry generates a **visual Arcform** — a glowing, constellation-like structure that evolves with the user's story.

This MVP now implements **modular architecture** with RIVET (safety validation) and ECHO (expressive response layer) modules migrated to their proper locations, providing a foundation for the complete 8-module system: ARC→PRISM→ECHO→ATLAS→MIRA→AURORA→VEIL→RIVET.

## Tools & Setup
- **Code tools**: Cursor (connected to GitHub), GitHub repo up to date, local clone active.
- **Framework**: Flutter (cross-platform, iOS/Android).
- **Simulator**: iPhone 16 (iOS).
- **Architecture**: Offline-first, encrypted local storage, cloud sync stubbed (Firebase/Supabase later).

---

## Core Flows (MVP)
1. **Onboarding (Reflective Scaffolding)**  
   - Gentle, 3-step flow: why you’re here, journaling tone, preferred rhythm.  
   - Data saved under `user_profiles/{uid}/onboarding`.

2. **Journal Capture**  
   - Minimalist text input (voice optional).  
   - Auto-save drafts.  
   - Save creates `JournalEntry` JSON object.  

3. **SAGE Echo (post-processing)**  
   - After save, entry is annotated with Situation, Action, Growth, Essence.  
   - User can review/edit.  

4. **Keyword Extraction & Review**  
   - 5–10 keywords suggested, user can edit.  
   - Stored on `JournalEntry`.  

5. **Arcform Renderer**  
   - Uses keywords to render constellation/radial layout.  
   - Geometry mapped to ATLAS phase hint (spiral, flower, branch, weave, glow core, fractal).  
   - Emotional colors: warm = growth, cool = recovery.
   - **Enhanced**: Interactive phase selector with live geometry previews
   - **Fixed**: Proper geometry recreation when changing phases, correct edge generation patterns  

6. **Timeline View**  
   - Chronological scroll of entries + Arcform snapshots.  
   - Cards show excerpt + Arcform thumbnail.  

7. **Insights & Your Patterns Visualization**
   - Graph view of keywords (nodes) and co-occurrences (edges).
   - Tap node to see linked entries.
   - **Fixed**: Insight cards now generate properly with real data instead of placeholders
   - **Enhanced**: Comprehensive Your Patterns visualization system with 4 views:
     - Word Cloud: Frequency-based keyword layout with emotion coloring
     - Network Graph: Force-directed physics layout with curved Bezier edges
     - Timeline: Chronological keyword trends with sparkline visualization
     - Radial: Central theme with spoke connections to related concepts
   - **Interactive Features**: Phase filtering, emotion filtering, time range selection
   - **MIRA Integration**: Co-occurrence matrix adapter for semantic memory data
   - **Visual Enhancements**: Phase icons, selection highlighting, neighbor filtering
   - **Full Integration**: "Your Patterns" card in Insights tab opens comprehensive visualization
   - **Production Ready**: 1200+ lines of new visualization code, legacy code cleaned up

8. **UI/UX with Roman Numeral 1 Tab Bar** ✅ COMPLETE
   - **Starting Screen**: Phase tab as default for immediate access to core functionality
   - **Journal Tab Redesign**: "+" icon for intuitive "add new entry" action
   - **Roman Numeral 1 Shape**: Elevated "+" button above tab bar for prominent primary action
   - **Tab Optimization**: Reduced height, padding, and icon sizes for better space utilization
   - **Your Patterns Priority**: Moved to top of Insights tab for better visibility
   - **Mini Radial Icon**: Custom visualization icon for Your Patterns card recognition
   - **Phase-Based Flow**: Smart startup logic - no phase → quiz, has phase → main menu
   - **Perfect Positioning**: Elevated button with optimal spacing and no screen edge cropping
