# ARC MVP — Project Brief for Cursor

## Overview
ARC is the **first module of EPI (Evolving Personal Intelligence)**. It is a journaling app that treats reflection as a **sacred act**. The experience should feel like the *Blessed* app: calming, atmospheric, and emotionally resonant. Journaling is the entry point, but the core differentiation is that each entry generates a **visual Arcform** — a glowing, constellation-like structure that evolves with the user’s story.

This MVP focuses on **journaling → keyword extraction → Arcform visualization**, with scaffolding in place for future EPI modules (ATLAS, AURORA, VEIL, Polymeta).

---

## Tools & Setup
- **Code tools**: Cursor (connected to GitHub), GitHub repo up to date, local clone active.
- **Framework**: Flutter (cross-platform, iOS/Android).
- **Simulator**: iPhone 16 (iOS).
- **Architecture**: Offline-first, encrypted local storage, cloud sync stubbed (Firebase/Supabase later).

---

## Core Flows (MVP)
1. **Onboarding (Reflective Scaffolding)**  
   - Gentle, 3-step flow: why you’re here, journaling tone, preferred rhythm.  
   - Data saved under `user_profiles/{uid}/onboarding`.

2. **Journal Capture**  
   - Minimalist text input (voice optional).  
   - Auto-save drafts.  
   - Save creates `JournalEntry` JSON object.  

3. **SAGE Echo (post-processing)**  
   - After save, entry is annotated with Situation, Action, Growth, Essence.  
   - User can review/edit.  

4. **Keyword Extraction & Review**  
   - 5–10 keywords suggested, user can edit.  
   - Stored on `JournalEntry`.  

5. **Arcform Renderer**  
   - Uses keywords to render constellation/radial layout.  
   - Geometry mapped to ATLAS phase hint (spiral, flower, branch, weave, glow core, fractal).  
   - Emotional colors: warm = growth, cool = recovery.  

6. **Timeline View**  
   - Chronological scroll of entries + Arcform snapshots.  
   - Cards show excerpt + Arcform thumbnail.  

7. **Insights (Polymeta v1)**  
   - Graph view of keywords (nodes) and co-occurrences (edges).  
   - Tap node to see linked entries.
