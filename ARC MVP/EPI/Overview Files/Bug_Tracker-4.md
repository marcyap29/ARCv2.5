## Bug ID: BUG-2025-09-23-004
**Title**: LUMARA Hardcoded Phase Detection

**Type**: Bug
**Priority**: P1 (Critical)
**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**Reporter**: User
**Assignee**: Claude Code
**Found Date**: 2025-09-23
**Fixed Date**: 2025-09-23

#### Description
LUMARA (powered by Gemini) was hardcoded to always use "Discovery" phase instead of the user's actual chosen phase from onboarding. When users asked LUMARA for more details, it would default to "Discovery" phase even though they had created other phases.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Complete onboarding and select a phase other than "Discovery"
2. Navigate to LUMARA tab
3. Ask LUMARA for more details about current phase
4. Observe LUMARA always responds with "Discovery" phase context

#### Root Cause Analysis
The `ContextProvider._generateMockPhaseData()` method in `lib/lumara/data/context_provider.dart` had hardcoded `'text': 'Discovery'` on line 115, completely ignoring the user's actual phase selection.

#### Solution Applied
- Integrated `UserPhaseService.getCurrentPhase()` to fetch actual user phase
- Updated both `_generateMockPhaseData()` and `_generateMockArcformData()` methods to use real phase data
- Made methods async to properly handle phase data fetching
- Added debug logging to track phase detection

#### Files Modified
- `lib/lumara/data/context_provider.dart` - Fixed hardcoded phase detection

#### Testing
- Verified LUMARA now uses actual user phase from onboarding
- Confirmed phase data flows correctly through context provider
- Tested with different phase selections during onboarding

## Bug ID: BUG-2025-09-23-005
**Title**: Timeline Phase Changes Not Persisting

**Type**: Bug
**Priority**: P1 (Critical)
**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**Reporter**: User
**Assignee**: Claude Code
**Found Date**: 2025-09-23
**Fixed Date**: 2025-09-23

#### Description
When users tried to change the phase of past entries in Timeline, clicking "Save" and exiting back to the main timeline would not persist the phase change. The phase would revert to the original value.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Timeline view
2. Select a past journal entry
3. Change the phase using the phase selector
4. Click "Save" button
5. Exit back to main timeline
6. Observe phase change has not persisted

#### Root Cause Analysis
The `updateEntryPhase()` method in `lib/features/timeline/timeline_cubit.dart` was only updating the `updatedAt` timestamp but not actually modifying the journal entry's phase metadata.

#### Solution Applied
- Enhanced `updateEntryPhase()` method to properly update journal entry metadata
- Added phase and geometry updates to the entry's metadata
- Added `updated_by_user` flag to track user modifications
- Ensured database persistence through proper repository integration

#### Files Modified
- `lib/features/timeline/timeline_cubit.dart` - Fixed phase persistence logic

#### Testing
- Verified phase changes now persist when users click "Save"
- Confirmed metadata updates are properly stored in database
- Tested with multiple entries and different phase selections

## Bug ID: BUG-2025-09-23-006
**Title**: Timeline Journal Entry Modifications Not Saving

**Type**: Bug
**Priority**: P1 (Critical)
**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**Reporter**: User
**Assignee**: Claude Code
**Found Date**: 2025-09-23
**Fixed Date**: 2025-09-23

#### Description
When users tried to modify journal entries in Timeline (add more text, update context), clicking "Save" would not persist the changes. The entry's updates would not stick and would revert to original content.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Timeline view
2. Select a past journal entry for editing
3. Modify the text content or add more context
4. Click "Save" button
5. Exit back to main timeline
6. Observe text changes have not persisted

#### Root Cause Analysis
The `_onSavePressed()` method in `lib/features/journal/widgets/journal_edit_view.dart` was just a TODO placeholder with no actual implementation. The method only showed a success message but didn't save any changes.

#### Solution Applied
- Implemented complete save functionality with proper repository integration
- Added error handling and user feedback via SnackBars
- Ensured database persistence through `JournalRepository.updateJournalEntry()`
- Added proper BuildContext safety with mounted checks
- Updated metadata including keywords, mood, phase, and geometry
- Added loading states and success/error feedback

#### Files Modified
- `lib/features/journal/widgets/journal_edit_view.dart` - Implemented save functionality

#### Testing
- Verified text updates now persist when users hit "Save"
- Confirmed all metadata updates are properly stored
- Tested error handling with various edge cases
- Verified user feedback works correctly

## Bug ID: BUG-2025-09-23-001
**Title**: GitHub Push Failures Due to Large Repository Pack Size

**Type**: Bug
**Priority**: P1 (Critical)
**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**Reporter**: System/Git
**Assignee**: Claude Code
**Found Date**: 2025-09-23
**Fixed Date**: 2025-09-23

#### Description
Git push operations were failing with HTTP 500 errors and timeouts when trying to push feature branches to GitHub. The issue was caused by large binary files (AI models, frameworks) being tracked in Git, creating 9.63 GB pack sizes that exceeded GitHub's transfer limits.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Attempt to push `mira-mcp-upgrade-and-integration` branch
2. Experience HTTP 500 errors and connection timeouts
3. See timeout during pack transmission despite multiple retry attempts
4. Push fails even with external temp directory and reduced pack settings

#### Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Issue**: Large binary files totaling 3+ GB were being tracked in Git:
- AI Models: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-Q4_K_M.gguf (2.3GB)
- AI Models: Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf (379MB)
- AI Models: tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.Q3_K_M.gguf (525MB)
- Dynamic Libraries: libllama.dylib files (multiple copies)
- Frameworks: Llama.xcframework directories with large binaries
- Build Artifacts: Various .DS_Store and generated files

**Secondary Issues**:
- .gitignore was insufficient to prevent large file tracking
- Git history contained multiple instances of these files across branches
- Pack compression couldn't reduce transfer size below GitHub limits

#### Resolution
**BFG Repo-Cleaner Strategy Applied**:
- Used BFG to remove large files from Git history: `bfg --delete-files "*.gguf"`
- Removed 3.2 GB of files from Git history across 528 commits
- Excluded all large binary files from Git tracking
- Enhanced .gitignore with comprehensive patterns:

```gitignore
# AI/ML Models (large binary files)
*.gguf
*.bin
*.model
*.weights

# Bundled frameworks
*.framework/
*.xcframework/

# Large media files
*.zip
*.tar
*.mp4
*.mov
```

#### Technical Changes
**Files Modified**:
- `.gitignore` - Added comprehensive large file exclusions
- Git History - Removed 3.2 GB of large files via BFG
- Repository Structure - Clean branch strategy for pushes

**Commands Applied**:
```bash
# Remove large files from Git tracking (keep locally)
git rm --cached "path/to/large/file"
find . -name "*.gguf" -print0 | xargs -0 git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch
find . -type d -name "*.xcframework" -print0 | xargs -0 git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch

# Create clean branch and push
git checkout -b main-clean
git push -u origin main-clean
```

#### Testing Results
- ✅ **Push Success**: Clean branch pushes immediately without timeouts
- ✅ **Repository Size**: Reduced from 9.63 GB to normal code-only size
- ✅ **Functionality Preserved**: All MIRA-MCP integration features intact
- ✅ **Development Workflow**: Normal Git operations restored

## Lessons Learned & Prevention Strategies

### Lessons Learned

1. **Widget Lifecycle Management**: Always validate `context.mounted` before overlay operations
2. **State Management**: Avoid duplicate BlocProviders; use global instances consistently
3. **Navigation Patterns**: Understand Flutter navigation context (tabs vs pushed routes)
4. **Progressive UX**: Implement conditional UI based on user progress/content
5. **Responsive Design**: Use constraint-based sizing instead of fixed dimensions
6. **API Consistency**: Verify method names match actual implementations
7. **User Flow Design**: Test complete user journeys to identify flow issues
8. **Save Functionality**: Ensure save operations actually persist data, not just navigate
9. **Visual Hierarchy**: Remove UI elements that don't serve the current step's purpose
10. **Natural Progression**: Design flows that match user mental models (write first, then reflect)
11. **Repository Management**: Large files (>50MB) cause GitHub push failures - use .gitignore and Git LFS
12. **Git History**: Complex merge histories create massive pack sizes - use clean branch strategies

### Prevention Strategies
