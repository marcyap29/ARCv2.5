# Bug Tracker Notes

## 2025-09-24 — MIRA Insights Implementation Complete ✅
- ✅ **Mixed-Version MCP Support**: Created golden bundle (`mcp_chats_2025-09_mixed_versions`) with node.v1 journals + node.v2 chat records
- ✅ **Chat Ingestion Layer**: Implemented `ChatIngest` and `ChatGraphBuilder` for converting chat models to MIRA nodes
- ✅ **Enhanced MCP Adapter**: Completed `MiraToMcpAdapter` supporting both node.v1 (legacy) and node.v2 (chat) formats with proper routing
- ✅ **Chat Metrics Integration**: Built `ChatMetricsService` and `EnhancedInsightService` wiring chat activity into the Insights system
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Added `mixed_version_test.dart` with AJV-ready validation for both schema versions
- ✅ **Repository Recovery**: Successfully repaired git corruption and restored all development work

**Key Components Added:**
- `lib/mcp/adapters/to_mcp.dart` - Full mixed-version adapter
- `lib/mira/insights/chat_metrics_service.dart` - Chat analytics
- `lib/mira/insights/enhanced_insight_service.dart` - Combined journal+chat insights
- `test/mcp/integration/mixed_version_test.dart` - Validation suite

**Architecture:** MIRA now supports both legacy journal entries (node.v1) and modern chat sessions (node.v2) in the same export bundles, maintaining backward compatibility while enabling rich chat-based insights.
