## Resolved Issues (v2.1.27)

### Calendar Scroll Sync Desynchronization
- **Issue**: Selecting a date in the "Jump to Date" picker caused the weekly calendar to jump approximately one week ahead of the target date.
- **Root Cause**: 
  1. `_timelineCardHeight` constant (280.0) in `InteractiveTimelineView` was overestimating actual item height, leading to incorrect index calculations.
  2. `CalendarWeekTimeline` was reacting to scroll notifications generated during the programmatic "jump" animation, causing it to drift.
- **Resolution**:
  1. Reduced `_timelineCardHeight` to 180.0 for better accuracy.
  2. Implemented `_isProgrammaticScroll` flag in `TimelineView` to suppress calendar updates during jump animations.
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Saved Chats Navigation Issue
- **Issue**: Clicking on "Saved Chats" in Chat History did not navigate to a list of saved chats, making them inaccessible.
- **Root Cause**: Missing dedicated screen and navigation logic for the saved chats section.
- **Resolution**: Created `SavedChatsScreen` and updated `EnhancedChatsScreen` to navigate to it.
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed
