# Stripe Secrets Setup Guide - Step by Step

**Project ID:** `arc-epi`  
**Date:** January 1, 2026

This guide will walk you through setting up all Stripe secrets in Firebase Secret Manager.

---

## Prerequisites

1. ✅ Stripe account (sign up at https://stripe.com if needed)
2. ✅ Firebase CLI installed and logged in
3. ✅ Access to Stripe Dashboard

---

## Step 1: Get Stripe API Keys (5 minutes)

### 1.1 Log into Stripe Dashboard
1. Go to [https://dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Log in with your Stripe account

### 1.2 Switch to Test Mode (IMPORTANT!)
**You're currently in LIVE mode - we need to switch to TEST mode for development.**

**The Test Mode toggle is in the Developers section, not on the home page!**

1. In the **left sidebar**, click **"Developers"** (you might need to scroll down or expand a section)
2. Click **"API keys"** in the Developers menu
3. At the **top of the API keys page**, you'll see a toggle switch that says:
   - **"Live mode"** (if you're in live mode) - it will be highlighted/green
   - **"Test mode"** (if you're in test mode) - it will be gray/blue
4. **Click the toggle** to switch from "Live mode" to "Test mode"
5. The page will refresh and you'll see test keys instead of live keys
6. The keys will now start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_` (instead of `pk_live_` and `sk_live_`)

**Alternative: Look for toggle in top right**
- Sometimes there's a toggle in the **top right corner** of any Stripe page
- It might say "Live" or "Test" - click it to switch modes

**Why Test Mode?**
- ✅ No real charges - safe for testing
- ✅ Use test card numbers
- ✅ Won't affect real customers
- ✅ Can test everything without risk

### 1.3 Get Your Secret Key (Test Mode)
**Make sure you're in TEST MODE before getting keys!**

1. In the **"For developers"** section on your dashboard, you should see:
   - **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_...` when in test mode)
   - **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_...` when in test mode) - **THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED**
2. Click the **eye icon** 👁️ next to the masked Secret key to reveal it
3. Copy the entire key (it looks like: `sk_test_51AbCdEf...`)
4. **IMPORTANT:** Make sure it starts with `sk_test_` (NOT `sk_live_`)
5. **Save this somewhere safe** - you'll need it in Step 4

**Alternative Method:**
- Click **"Developers"** in the left sidebar
- Click **"API keys"**
- You'll see the same keys there
- Click **"Reveal test key"** to see your secret key

## Step 2: Create Products and Get Price IDs (10 minutes)

### 2.1 Create the Premium Product
1. In Stripe Dashboard, click **"Products"** in the left sidebar
2. Click the **"+ Add product"** button (top right)
3. Fill in the product details:
   - **Name:** `ARC Premium`
   - **Description:** `Premium subscription for ARC app with unlimited LUMARA access`
   - Leave other fields as default
4. Scroll down to **"Pricing"** section
5. Click **"Add another price"** to add both monthly and annual prices

### 2.2 Add Monthly Price ($30/month)
1. In the pricing section:
   - **Price:** `30.00`
   - **Currency:** `USD` (or your currency)
   - **Billing period:** Select **"Recurring"** → **"Monthly"**
2. Click **"Add price"** or **"Save product"**

### 2.3 Add Annual Price ($200/year)
1. Still in the same product, click **"Add another price"**
2. Fill in:
   - **Price:** `200.00`
   - **Currency:** `USD`
   - **Billing period:** Select **"Recurring"** → **"Yearly"**
3. Click **"Save product"**

### 2.4 Get Your Price IDs
1. After saving, you'll see your product page
2. You'll see both prices listed
3. For each price, click on it to open the price details
4. Copy the **Price ID** (starts with `price_...`)
   - **Monthly Price ID:** `price_...` (save this)
   - **Annual Price ID:** `price_...` (save this)
5. **Save both Price IDs** - you'll need them in Step 3

## Step 3: Set Up Webhook (10 minutes)

### 3.1 Create Webhook Endpoint (Called "Destination" in New Interface)
**Note:** In Stripe's newer interface, webhook endpoints are called "destinations" - they're the same thing!

1. In Stripe Dashboard, you're already on the **"Webhooks"** page (I can see you're in the Workbench)
2. Click the **"+ Add destination"** button (purple button with plus icon)
3. You'll be asked to choose a destination type - select **"Webhook endpoint"** (or just "Webhook")
4. In the **"Endpoint URL"** field, enter:
   ```
   https://us-central1-arc-epi.cloudfunctions.net/stripeWebhook
   ```
   (This is your Firebase project's webhook URL)

### 3.2 Select Events to Listen To
1. Click **"Select events"**
2. Check these events:
   - ✅ `checkout.session.completed`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.created`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.updated`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - ✅ `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - ✅ `invoice.payment_failed`
3. Click **"Add events"**

### 3.3 Get Webhook Signing Secret
1. Click **"Add endpoint"** to create the webhook
2. After creation, you'll see your webhook in the list
3. Click on the webhook to open its details
4. Find **"Signing secret"** section
5. Click **"Reveal"** next to the signing secret
6. Copy the webhook secret (starts with `whsec_...`)
7. **Save this** - you'll need it in Step 4

## Step 4: Add Secrets to Firebase (5 minutes)

Now we'll add all the secrets to Firebase Secret Manager using the Firebase CLI.

### 4.1 Navigate to Project Directory
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
cd "/Users/mymac/Software/Development/ARCv1.0/functions"
```

### 4.2 Add Stripe Secret Key
Run this command:
```bash
firebase functions:secrets:set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
```

**When prompted:**
- Paste your Stripe Secret Key (the `sk_test_...` key from Step 1.3)
- Press Enter
- You'll see: `✔ Created a new secret version for STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`

### 4.3 Add Monthly Price ID
Run this command:
```bash
firebase functions:secrets:set STRIPE_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY
```

**When prompted:**
- Paste your Monthly Price ID (the `price_...` from Step 2.4)
- Press Enter
- You'll see: `✔ Created a new secret version for STRIPE_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY`

### 4.4 Add Annual Price ID
Run this command:
```bash
firebase functions:secrets:set STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ANNUAL
```

**When prompted:**
- Paste your Annual Price ID (the `price_...` from Step 2.4)
- Press Enter
- You'll see: `✔ Created a new secret version for STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ANNUAL`

### 4.5 Add Webhook Secret
Run this command:
```bash
firebase functions:secrets:set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

**When prompted:**
- Paste your Webhook Secret (the `whsec_...` from Step 3.3)
- Press Enter
- You'll see: `✔ Created a new secret version for STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 4.6 Verify Secrets Are Set
Run this command to verify:
```bash
firebase functions:secrets:access STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
```

You should see your secret key displayed (or a message confirming it exists).

---

## Step 5: Deploy Functions (2 minutes)

Now deploy the functions so they can use the secrets:

```bash
cd "/Users/mymac/Software/Development/ARCv1.0"
firebase deploy --only functions:createCheckoutSession,functions:createPortalSession,functions:stripeWebhook
```

Wait for the deployment to complete. You should see:
```
✔ functions[createCheckoutSession(us-central1)] Successful update operation.
✔ functions[createPortalSession(us-central1)] Successful update operation.
✔ functions[stripeWebhook(us-central1)] Successful update operation.
```

## Step 6: Test the Integration (5 minutes)

### 6.1 Test in Your App
1. Open your ARC app
2. Sign in with a test account (not your premium email)
3. Navigate to **Settings** → **Subscription Management**
4. Click **"Subscribe"** (either Monthly or Annual)
5. You should now be redirected to Stripe Checkout (no more UNAUTHENTICATED error!)

### 6.2 Use Test Card
In the Stripe Checkout page:
- **Card Number:** `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Expiry:** Any future date (e.g., `12/25`)
- **CVC:** Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
- **ZIP:** Any 5 digits (e.g., `12345`)

Click **"Subscribe"** to complete the test payment.

### 6.3 Verify Subscription
1. After payment, you should be redirected back to the app
2. Check your subscription status - it should show "Premium"
3. Go to Stripe Dashboard → **Customers** → Find your test customer
4. You should see the subscription is active

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Secret not found"
- Make sure you're in the correct directory (`/functions`)
- Verify you're logged into Firebase: `firebase login`
- Check project: `firebase use arc-epi`

### Error: "UNAUTHENTICATED" still appears
- Make sure all secrets are set correctly
- Redeploy the functions after setting secrets
- Check function logs: `firebase functions:log`

### Webhook not working
- Verify webhook URL is exactly: `https://us-central1-arc-epi.cloudfunctions.net/stripeWebhook`
- Check Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks → Your endpoint → Events tab
- Make sure webhook secret matches what you set in Firebase

### Can't find Price IDs
- Go to Stripe Dashboard → Products
- Click on your "ARC Premium" product
- Click on each price to see its details
- The Price ID is shown at the top of the price details page

## What's Next?

Once everything is set up:
1. ✅ Test the full subscription flow
2. ✅ Test subscription cancellation
3. ✅ Test Customer Portal (Manage Subscription button)
4. ✅ Monitor webhook events in Stripe Dashboard
5. ✅ Check Firebase Functions logs for any errors

When ready for production:
1. Switch Stripe Dashboard to **Live Mode**
2. Get live API keys
3. Create new webhook endpoint for live mode
4. Update all secrets with live keys
5. Test with real cards (small amounts first!)

## Security Notes

✅ All secrets are stored securely in Firebase Secret Manager  
✅ Secrets are never exposed to the client  
✅ Webhook signatures are verified  
✅ All payment processing happens on Stripe's secure servers
