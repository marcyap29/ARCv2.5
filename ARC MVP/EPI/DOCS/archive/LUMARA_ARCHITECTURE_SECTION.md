This document was the **architecture section** for the Narrative Intelligence white paper, aligned with the EPI repository.

## 2 System Architecture

Narrative Intelligence is composed of five integrated modules:

1. **LUMARA** — Integrative Intelligence Layer  
2. **PRISM** — Multimodal Perception & Analysis (includes the Developmental Phase Engine, ATLAS)  
3. **CHRONICLE** — Longitudinal Memory and Vector Layer  
4. **AURORA** — Circadian Orchestration Layer  
5. **ECHO** — Response Control and Privacy Layer  

RIVET and SENTINEL operate within **ATLAS**, the Developmental Phase Engine, which is implemented as part of PRISM.

## 2.1 Architectural Hierarchy

At the center of the system is **LUMARA**, the integrative intelligence layer. LUMARA coordinates signals from CHRONICLE, ATLAS, and AURORA; fused into a trajectory-conditioned master prompt, processed through ECHO. See `DOCS/ARCHITECTURE.md` for implementation traceability.
