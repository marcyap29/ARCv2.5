## Bug ID: BUG-2025-08-30-001
**Title**: "Begin Your Journey" Welcome Button Text Truncated

**Severity**: Medium  
**Priority**: P2 (High)  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Reporter**: User Testing  
**Assignee**: Claude Code  
**Found Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Fixed Date**: 2025-08-30  

#### Description
The welcome screen's main call-to-action button "Begin Your Journey" was cut off on various screen sizes due to fixed width constraints.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Launch app on iPhone simulator
2. View welcome screen
3. Observe button text truncation

#### Expected Behavior
Button should display full text "Begin Your Journey" on all screen sizes

#### Actual Behavior
Button text was cut off, showing only partial text

#### Environment
- Device: iPhone 16 Pro Simulator
- OS: iOS 18.0
- Flutter Version: Latest
- App Version: MVP

#### Root Cause
Fixed width of 200px was too narrow for button text content

#### Solution
Implemented responsive design with constraints-based sizing:
- Changed from fixed width to `width: double.infinity`
- Added constraints: `minWidth: 240, maxWidth: 320`
- Added horizontal padding for proper spacing

#### Files Modified
- `lib/features/startup/welcome_view.dart`

#### Testing Notes
Verified button displays correctly on various screen sizes in simulator

## Bug ID: BUG-2025-08-30-002
**Title**: Premature Keywords Section Causing Cognitive Load During Writing

**Severity**: High  
**Priority**: P2 (High)  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Reporter**: UX Review  
**Assignee**: Claude Code  
**Found Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Fixed Date**: 2025-08-30  

#### Description
Keywords extraction section appeared immediately during journal text entry, creating distraction and cognitive load during the writing process.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Journal tab
2. Start typing in text field
3. Observe keywords section appearing immediately

#### Expected Behavior
Keywords section should only appear after substantial content has been written

#### Actual Behavior
Keywords section was always visible during text entry

#### Root Cause
UI was not conditional - keywords section always rendered regardless of content length

#### Solution
Implemented progressive disclosure:
- Keywords section only shows when `_textController.text.trim().split(' ').length >= 10`
- Clean writing interface maintained for initial text entry

#### Files Modified
- `lib/features/journal/journal_capture_view.dart`

#### Testing Notes
Verified keywords section appears only after meaningful content (10+ words)

## Bug ID: BUG-2025-08-30-003
**Title**: Infinite Save Spinner - Journal Save Button Never Completes

**Severity**: Critical  
**Priority**: P1 (Blocker)  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Reporter**: User Testing  
**Assignee**: Claude Code  
**Found Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Fixed Date**: 2025-08-30  

#### Description
When user writes journal entry and hits save, the save button shows infinite loading spinner that never completes, preventing successful entry saving.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Write journal entry
2. Select mood
3. Click save button
4. Observe infinite spinner

#### Expected Behavior
Save should complete quickly with success feedback

#### Actual Behavior
Save button spinner continued indefinitely without completion

#### Root Cause
Duplicate BlocProvider instances in journal view creating state isolation - save state wasn't reaching UI listener

#### Solution
Removed duplicate local BlocProviders and used global app-level providers:
- Eliminated `MultiBlocProvider` wrapper in journal view
- Used `context.read<JournalCaptureCubit>()` to access global instance
- Ensured save state properly propagates to UI

#### Files Modified
- `lib/features/journal/journal_capture_view.dart`
- `lib/app/app.dart` (global provider architecture was already correct)

#### Testing Notes
Verified save completes immediately with success notification

## Bug ID: BUG-2025-08-30-004
**Title**: Navigation Black Screen Loop After Journal Save

**Severity**: Critical  
**Priority**: P1 (Blocker)  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Reporter**: User Testing  
**Assignee**: Claude Code  
**Found Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Fixed Date**: 2025-08-30  

#### Description
After saving journal entry, screen swipes right and goes to empty black screen, seemingly stuck in navigation loop.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Write and save journal entry
2. Observe screen transition after save
3. See black screen with no content

#### Expected Behavior
After save, should navigate smoothly to timeline or stay on journal

#### Actual Behavior
Navigation resulted in black screen loop

#### Root Cause
`Navigator.pop(context)` was being called on a journal screen that was embedded as a tab (not a pushed route), causing navigation confusion

#### Solution
Replaced `Navigator.pop(context)` with tab navigation:
- Changed to `homeCubit.changeTab(2)` to navigate to Timeline tab
- Added HomeCubit import for proper tab management
- Maintained smooth user flow: Journal → Save → Timeline

#### Files Modified
- `lib/features/journal/journal_capture_view.dart`

#### Testing Notes
Verified smooth navigation from journal save to timeline view

## Bug ID: BUG-2025-08-30-005
**Title**: Critical Widget Lifecycle Error Preventing App Startup

**Severity**: Critical  
**Priority**: P1 (Blocker)  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Reporter**: Simulator Testing  
**Assignee**: Claude Code  
**Found Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Fixed Date**: 2025-08-30  

#### Description
Flutter widget lifecycle error "Looking up a deactivated widget's ancestor is unsafe" preventing app from starting successfully.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Launch app on iPhone simulator
2. Observe startup crash with widget lifecycle error
3. App fails to initialize properly

#### Expected Behavior
App should start cleanly without lifecycle errors

#### Actual Behavior
App crashed on startup with deactivated widget ancestor error

#### Root Cause
New notification and animation overlay systems accessing deactivated widget contexts:
- Overlay management without context validation
- Async operations executing after widget disposal  
- Animation controllers operating on disposed widgets

#### Solution
Comprehensive widget safety implementation:
- Added `context.mounted` validation before overlay access
- Implemented `mounted` state checks for animation controllers
- Protected async Future.delayed callbacks with mount verification
- Added null-safe overlay access patterns

#### Files Modified
- `lib/shared/in_app_notification.dart`
- `lib/shared/arcform_intro_animation.dart` 
- `lib/features/journal/journal_capture_view.dart`

#### Testing Notes
- ✅ Clean app startup on iPhone 16 Pro simulator
- ✅ Stable notification display and dismissal
- ✅ Reliable Arcform animation sequences
- ✅ Safe tab navigation during async operations

## Bug ID: BUG-2025-08-30-006
**Title**: Method Not Found Error - SimpleArcformStorage.getAllArcforms()

**Severity**: High  
**Priority**: P2 (High)  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Reporter**: Build System  
**Assignee**: Claude Code  
**Found Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Fixed Date**: 2025-08-30  

#### Description
Compilation error: "Member not found: 'SimpleArcformStorage.getAllArcforms'" preventing successful build.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `flutter run -d "iPhone 16 Pro"`
2. Observe compilation failure
3. See method not found error

#### Expected Behavior
App should compile and run without method errors

#### Actual Behavior
Build failed with method not found error

#### Root Cause
Incorrect method name - actual method is `loadAllArcforms()` not `getAllArcforms()`

#### Solution
Updated method call to use correct name:
- Changed `SimpleArcformStorage.getAllArcforms()` to `SimpleArcformStorage.loadAllArcforms()`

#### Files Modified
- `lib/features/journal/journal_capture_view.dart`

#### Testing Notes
Verified app compiles and runs successfully on iPhone 16 Pro simulator

## Lessons Learned

1. **Widget Lifecycle Management**: Always validate `context.mounted` before overlay operations
2. **State Management**: Avoid duplicate BlocProviders; use global instances consistently  
3. **Navigation Patterns**: Understand Flutter navigation context (tabs vs pushed routes)
4. **Progressive UX**: Implement conditional UI based on user progress/content
5. **Responsive Design**: Use constraint-based sizing instead of fixed dimensions
6. **API Consistency**: Verify method names match actual implementations

---

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Widget Safety Checklist**: Standard patterns for overlay and animation lifecycle management
2. **State Architecture Review**: Consistent global provider patterns documented
3. **Navigation Testing**: Test all navigation paths in development
4. **UX Flow Validation**: Review progressive disclosure patterns with users
5. **API Integration Testing**: Automated checks for method name consistency
